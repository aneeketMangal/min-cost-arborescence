Input Format
First line: Number of Test Cases T and then follows their description
For each test case,
first row indicate N M s (single space separated)
where,
N is number of vertices in directed graph where vertices are labelled 1 to N (not 0 indexing)
M is the number of edges and
s is the index of source vertex
And then M rows mentioning u v w(u,v) (single space separated, where u and v are vertex ids and w is
weight, Safely assume all edge weights are non-negative, else print -1 for the output)

Output Format:-
T, no of test cases
Output row for each test case has 2N+1+1 entries (all single space separated)
where first entry is the total sum of min cost arborescence
and then N entries corresponding to vertices V1, V2, V3..., VN providing the distance of i-th vertex from the
source vertex s. (Indicate -1 if unreachable)
and then Symbol #
and then N entries (corresponding to vertices V1, V2, V3..., VN) providing the label of the parent node through
which one reaches i-th vertex (basically second last node in path from source vertex to that i-th vertex. (Indicate
0 if no parent i.e. for source vertex and -1 if vertex i not reachable)
